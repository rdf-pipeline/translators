In the process of renaming CMUMPS to CHCS throughout our repos.
As of this writing, the renaming has been completed in the cmumps-to-chcs
branch of this repo (with all tests producing the same results as
they did before, even though 3 fail), EXCEPT that some embedded github URLs
need to be renamed to point to the master branch instead of this
branch.
