# fake Composite MUMPS (cmumps) data

The data in this directory was generated for testing cmumps parsing and to serve as an input case for the pipeline.

The format is real, but the actual data content is not. 

The example directory is`patient-7`:

```
patient-7/
├── aalter-patient7-procedures.jsonld
├── cmumps-patient7.jsonld
├── context.jsonld
├── expected/**  # expected output from translations
├── output/** # generated output, working area; see output/Makefile for more
└── README.md # you are here
```
